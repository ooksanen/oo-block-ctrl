# oo-block-ctrl

A very simple WordPress plugin to unregister Gutenberg core blocks.

You can unregister any block by uncommenting the correct line.

Iâ€™ve also added core block variations and examples of how to disable them, WooCommerce blocks for reference as well as an example of how to register your own custom block styles.
